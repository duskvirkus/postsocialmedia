    <h2>The Now of Queer Futurity</h2>

    <img src="/images/artwork/the-now-of-queer-futurity/the-now-of-queer-futurity-duskvirkus.jpg" alt="A mostly white painting hangs on a white wall. The painting shows a classically shaped Coca-Cola bottle with the word love scrawled across the front. In the bottle there is a yellow rose that is somewhat wilted, so it is slumped over. There are some other plant branches coming out of the bottle and there’s light gray shadow of the objects along the bottom.">

    <p>Acrylic on Baltic Birch Panel, 18 inches by 24 inches, March 2021</p>

    <p>Artist Statement: Advanced by Jose Esteban Munoz’s writing in Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, Warhol’s work Still Life (Flowers) can be read as queering a Coca-Cola bottle by adding a flower to it. My work offers an examination of this concept in the modern day. It provides a commentary on Coca-Cola’s participation in pinkwashing queer pride. Pinkwashing in the context of pride is companies using sponsorships to improve public relations and plastering products with rainbows to profit while not contributing to or actively fighting against systemic change.</p>

    <img src="/images/artwork/january-31-2021-at-544am/january-31-2021-at-544am.jpg" alt="A painting hangs on a white wall. The painting depicts a syringe, vial, and other non-descript paper materials. It is done with playful brush strokes but there are sections of the painting near the middle that are sharper. Most of the color in the work is a cool dark blue with some lighter shades and there are patches of warmer browns throughout the work.">
